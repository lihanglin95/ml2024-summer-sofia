Module 4:

The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it

Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one)

In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputed it before.

Module 5:

1. Create a Python program:

The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it

Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one)

In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputted it before.

The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data search) should be done via Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm (i.e. using Classes)

Name this program "module5_oop.py" and upload it to the above-mentioned repo.

2. Create the functionality outside of the main running code: i.e., create the module with the Class described in the item above, and name this module "module5_mod.py" + create the main program "module5_call.py" that uses the Class description from the "*_mod" file.  Upload everything to the above-mentioned repo.
